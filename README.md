I usually go by Sinon online. I'm a 12th grader writing the RISC-V backend and doing optimization for [Zig](https://github.com/ziglang/zig).

I enjoy low-level optimizations, CPU pipelining, computational optimization, cache coherency protocols, writing high-performance virtual machines, and anything else related to the interface between hardware and software.
